  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian computation have until recently been restricted to problems where the joint distribution of all variables has a density with respect to some xed standard underlying measure. They have therefore not been available for application to Bayesian model determination, where the dimensionality of the parameter vector is typically not xed. This article proposes a new framework for the construction of reversible Markov chain samplers that jump between parameter subspaces of di ering dimensionality, which is exible and entirely constructive. It should therefore have wide applicability in model determination problems. The methodology is illustrated with applications to multiple change-point analysis in one and two dimensions, and toaBayesian comparison of binomial experiments.},

  abstract     = {Variable selection in the linear regression model takes many apparent faces from both frequentist and Bayesian standpoints. In this paper we introduce a variable selection method referred to as a rescaled spike and slab model. We study the importance of prior hierarchical specifications and draw connections to frequentist generalized ridge regression estimation. Specifically, we study the usefulness of continuous bimodal priors to model hypervariance parameters, and the effect scaling has on the posterior mean through its relationship to penalization. Several model selection strategies, some frequentist and some Bayesian in nature, are developed and studied theoretically. We demonstrate the importance of selective shrinkage for effective variable selection in terms of risk misclassification, and show this is achieved using the posterior from a rescaled spike and slab model. We also show how to verify a procedure's ability to reduce model uncertainty in finite samples using a specialized forward selection strategy. Using this tool, we illustrate the effectiveness of rescaled spike and slab models in reducing model uncertainty.},

  title       = {Fast Bayesian Lasso for High-Dimensional Regression},
  year        = {2015},
  abstract    = {The lasso (Tibshirani, 1996) is an essential tool in modern high-dimensional regression and variable selection. The Bayesian lasso of Park and Casella (2008) interprets the lasso objective function as a posterior under a Laplace prior and proposes a three-step Gibbs sampler to sample from this posterior. The Bayesian lasso yields a natural approach to quantifying the uncertainty of lasso estimates. Furthermore, the Gibbs sampler for the Bayesian lasso has been shown to be geometrically ergodic (Khare and Hobert, 2013). The geometric rate constant of this Markov chain, however, tends to 1 if the number of regression coefficients grows faster than the sample size (Rajaratnam and Sparks, 2015). Thus, convergence of the Bayesian lasso Gibbs sampler can still be quite slow in modern high-dimensional settings despite the apparent theoretical safeguard of geometric ergodicity. In order to address this challenge, we propose a new method to draw from the same posterior via a tractable two-step blocked Gibbs sampler, which we call the fast Bayesian lasso. We provide a theoretical underpinning to the new method by proving rigorously that the fast Bayesian lasso is geometrically ergodic. We then demonstrate numerically that this blocked sampler exhibits vastly superior convergence behavior in high-dimensional regimes.},

  title       = {Lasso Regression: Estimation and Shrinkage via Limit of Gibbs Sampling},
  abstract    = {The application of the lasso is espoused in high-dimensional settings where only a small number of the regression coefficients are believed to be nonzero. Moreover, statistical properties of high-dimensional lasso estimators are often proved under the assumption that the correlation between the predictors is bounded. In this vein, coordinatewise methods, the most common means of computing the lasso solution, work well in the presence of low to moderate multicollinearity. The computational speed of coordinatewise algorithms degrades however as sparsity decreases and multicollinearity increases. Motivated by these limitations, we propose the novel "Deterministic Bayesian Lasso" algorithm for computing the lasso solution. This algorithm is developed by considering a limiting version of the Bayesian lasso. The performance of the Deterministic Bayesian Lasso improves as sparsity decreases and multicollinearity increases, and can offer substantial increases in computational speed. A rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrates that (1) the Deterministic Bayesian Lasso algorithm converges to the lasso solution, and (2) it leads to a representation of the lasso estimator which shows how it achieves both $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ types of shrinkage simultaneously. Connections to other algorithms are also provided. The benefits of the Deterministic Bayesian Lasso algorithm are then illustrated on simulated and real data.},

  abstract = {A threshold stochastic volatility (SV) model is used for capturing time-varying volatilities and nonlinearity. Two adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods of model selection are designed for the selection of threshold variables for this family of SV models. The first method is the direct estimation which approximates the model posterior probabilities of competing models. Using parallel MCMC sampling to estimate these probabilities, the best threshold variable is selected with the highest posterior model probability. The second method is to use the deviance information criterion to compare among these competing models and select the best one. Simulation results lead us to conclude that for large samples the posterior model probability approximation method can give an accurate approximation of the posterior probability in Bayesian model selection. The method delivers a powerful and sharp model selection tool. An empirical study of five Asian stock markets provides strong support for the threshold variable which is formulated as a weighted average of important variables.},

  abstract = {Bayesian analysis of threshold autoregressive (TAR) model with various possible thresholds is considered. A method of Bayesian stochastic search selection is introduced to identify a threshold-dependent sequence with highest probability. All model parameters are computed by a hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo method, which combines Metropolis--Hastings algorithm and Gibbs sampler. The main innovation of the method introduced here is to estimate the TAR model without assuming the fixed number of threshold values, thus is more flexible and useful. Simulation experiments and a real data example lend further support to the proposed approach.},

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

In particular, we propose a method that we call WLadaLASSO (weighted lag adaptive LASSO), which assigns not only different weights to each coefficient but also further penalizes coefficients of higher?lagged covariates. In our Monte Carlo implementation, the WLadaLASSO is superior in terms of covariate selection, parameter estimation precision and forecasting, when compared to both LASSO and adaLASSO, especially for a higher number of candidate lags and a stronger linear dependence between predictors. Empirical studies illustrate our approach for US risk premium and US inflation forecasting with good results. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

After observing the data, the posterior distribution provides a coherent post data summary of the remaining uncertainty which is relevant for model selection. However, the practical implementation of this approach often requires carefully tailored priors and novel posterior calculation methods. In this article, we illustrate some of the fundamental practical issues that arise for two different model selection problems: the variable selection problem for the linear model and the CART model selection problem.},

  abstract  = {The wide applicability of Gibbs sampling has increased the use of more complex and multilevel hierarchical models. To use these models entails dealing with hyperparameters in the deeper levels of a hierarchy. There are three typical methods for dealing with these hyperparameters: specify them, estimate them, or use a flat prior. Each of these strategies has its own associated problems. In this paper, using an empirical Bayes approach, we show how the hyperparameters can be estimated in a way that is both computationally feasible and statistically valid.},

We expand the usual regression equation to an equation that incorporates all possible subsets of predictors by adding indicator variables as parameters. The vector of indicator variables dictates which predictors to include. Several choices of priors can be employed for the unknown regression coefficients and the unknown indicator parameters. The posterior distribution of the indicator vector is approximated by means of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We select subsets with high posterior probabilities. In addition to linear models, we consider generalized linear models.},

We focus on the appropriate specification for the shrinkage parameter ? through Bayes factors that evaluate the inclusion of each covariate in the model formulation. We associate this parameter with the values of Pearson and partial correlation at the limits between significance and insignificance as defined by Bayes factors. In this way, a meaningful interpretation of ? is achieved that leads to a simple specification of this parameter. Moreover, we use these values to specify the parameters of a gamma hyperprior for ? . The parameters of the hyperprior are elicited such that appropriate levels of practical significance of the Pearson correlation are achieved and, at the same time, the prior support of ? values that activate the Lindley-Bartlett paradox or lead to over-shrinkage of model coefficients is avoided. The proposed method is illustrated using two simulation studies and a real dataset. For the first simulation study, results for different prior values of ? are presented as well as a detailed robustness analysis concerning the parameters of the hyperprior of ? . In all examples, detailed comparisons with a variety of ordinary and Bayesian lasso methods are presented.},

We prove two theorems: one that characterizes the horseshoe estimator&rsquo;s tail robustness and the other that demonstrates a super-efficient rate of convergence to the correct estimate of the sampling density in sparse situations. Finally, using both real and simulated data, we show that the horseshoe estimator corresponds quite closely to the answers obtained by Bayesian model averaging under a point-mass mixture prior.},

  abstract  = {A compositional time series is a multivariate time series in which the observation vector at each time point is a set of proportions that sum to 1. Traditionally, such time series are modeled by taking a log-ratio transformation of the observations and then modeling them with a Gaussian vector autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. In this paper, a new class of models is proposed by assuming that the proportions follow a time-varying Dirichlet distribution, and that the corresponding time-varying parameters, after a proper transformation, assume an ARMA-type of dynamic structure. The new model is referred to as the Dirichlet autoregressive moving average (DARMA) model. Under this model, after a proper transformation, the original data follow a vector ARMA model with a martingale difference sequence as its noise series. Two specific transformations are studied under the DARMA framework. Estimation procedures are developed and their numerical properties are investigated. Simulation studies and real examples are presented to demonstrate the properties of the proposed models, and comparisons are made with the existing modeling approaches.},

Comparisons are also made with the consensus forecasts from the Survey of Professional Forecasters. In addition, the forecasts of nonlinear models are combined with the consensus forecasts. The results show that significant improvements in forecasting accuracy can be obtained over existing methods.},

The forecasting methods are based on four classes of models: autoregressions (with and without unit root pretests), exponential smoothing, artificial neural networks, and smooth transition autoregressions. The best overall performance of a single method is achieved by autoregressions with unit root pretests, but this performance can be improved when it is combined with the forecasts from other methods.},

Which approach is better is an empirical matter: in theory, iterated forecasts are more efficient if the one-period ahead model is correctly specified, but direct forecasts are more robust to model misspecification. This paper compares empirical iterated and direct forecasts from linear univariate and bivariate models by applying simulated out-of-sample methods to 170 U.S. monthly macroeconomic time series spanning 1959–2002. The iterated forecasts typically outperform the direct forecasts, particularly, if the models can select long-lag specifications.

Traffic flow data are in the form of spatial time series and are collected at specific locations at constant intervals of time. Important spatial characteristics of the space–time process are incorporated in the STARIMA model through the use of weighting matrices estimated on the basis of the distances among the various locations where data are collected. These matrices distinguish the space–time approach from the vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) methodology and enable the model builders to control the number of the parameters that have to be estimated. The proposed models can be used for short-term forecasting of space–time stationary traffic-flow processes and for assessing the impact of traffic-flow changes on other parts of the network. The three-stage iterative space–time model building procedure is illustrated using 7.5 min average traffic flow data for a set of 25 loop-detectors located at roads that direct to the centre of the city of Athens, Greece. Data for two months with different traffic-flow characteristics are modelled in order to determine the stability of the parameter estimation.},

  abstract  = {Information signal from real case and natural complex dynamical systems such as traffic flow are usually specified by irregular motions. Chaotic nonlinear dynamics approach is now the most powerful tool for scientists to deal with complexities in real cases, and neural networks and neuro-fuzzy models are widely used for their capabilities in nonlinear modeling of chaotic systems more than the traditional methods. As mentioned, the traffic flow conditions caused the forecasting values of traffic flow to lack robustness and accuracy. In this paper, the traffic flow forecasting is analyzed with emotional concepts and multi-agent systems (MASs) points of view as a new method in this field. The findings enabled the researchers to develop a newly object-oriented method of forecasting traffic flow. Its architecture is based on a temporal difference (TD) Q-learning with a neuro-fuzzy structure, which is the nonparametric approach. The performance of TD Q-learning is improved by emotional learning. The proposed method on the present conditions and the action of the system according to the criteria could forecast traffic signals so that the objectives are reached in minimum time. The ability of presented learning algorithm to prospect gains from future actions and obtain rewards from its past experiences allows emotional TD Q-learning algorithm to improve its decisions for the best possible actions. In addition, to study in a more practical situation, the neuro-fuzzy behaviors could be modeled by MAS. The proposed method (intelligent/nonparametric approach) is compared by parametric approach, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method, which is implemented by multi-layer perceptron neural networks and called ARIMANN. Here, the ARIMANN is updated by backpropagation and temporal difference backpropagation for the first time. The simulation results revealed that the studied forecaster could discover the optimal forecasting by means of the Q-learning algorithm. Difficult to handle through parametric and classic methods, the real traffic flow signals used for fitting the algorithms is obtained from a two-lane street I-494 in Minnesota City.},

  abstract  = {<p> The capability to forecast traffic volume in an operational setting has been identified as a critical need for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In particular, traffic volume forecasts will support proactive, dynamic traffic control. However, previous attempts to develop traffic volume forecasting models have met with limited success. This research effort focused on developing traffic volume forecasting models for two sites on Northern Virginia's Capital Beltway. Four models were developed and tested for the freeway traffic flow forecasting problem, which is defined as estimating traffic flow 15 min into the future. They were the historical average, time-series, neural network, and nonparametric regression models. The nonparametric regression model significantly outperformed the other models. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed that the nonparametric regression model experienced significantly lower errors than the other models. In addition, the nonparametric regression model was easy to implement, and proved to be portable, performing well at two distinct sites. Based on its success, research is ongoing to refine the nonparametric regression model and to extend it to produce multiple interval forecasts.</p>},

Univariate short-term traffic flow prediction algorithms are popular in literature. However, to facilitate the operationalities of advanced adaptive traffic management systems, there is a necessity of developing multivariate traffic condition prediction algorithms. A new multivariate short-term traffic flow and speed prediction methodology is proposed in this paper where the traffic flow and speed observations from uncongested (or linear) and congested (or nonlinear) regimes are regime-adjusted to ensure consistent system dynamics. The prediction methodology is developed by using artificial neural networks (ANN) algorithms in conjunction with adaptive learning rules. These learning rules demonstrate significantly improved accuracy and simultaneous reduction in computation times. Additionally, the paper attempts to identify the most suitable adaptive learning rule from a chosen pool of rules. The validation of the prediction methodology is performed by using traffic data from multiple locations in the United Kingdom (U.K.). The results indicate that the proposed multivariate forecasting algorithm is effective and computationally parsimonious to simultaneously predict traffic flow and speed in freeway or highway networks.</p>},

A possible implication of this might be that the traffic processes at these scales are related through a chaotic (scale-invariant) behavior. A comparison of the correlation dimension and coefficient of variation of each of the time series reveals a direct relationship between the two: higher dimension for higher coefficient of variation and vice versa.},

Correlation dimensions and recurrence plots were calculated to analyze a freeway traffic flow. It is found that the traffic flow is chaotic and fractal under a large range of observation time windows. Correlation dimensions decrease with the increasing of time windows in minute scales. Different from the formerly deduction that fractal characteristics would vanish with the decreasing of time windows, the numerical estimation results show that correlation dimensions increase with the increasing of time windows in second scales. It is also suggested that a reliable forecasting requires that the length of historical data should be more than ten times of correlation dimensions of a short-term traffic flow.},

Furthermore, the likelihood of powered-two-wheelers (PTWs) involvement in an accident is examined. To achieve the aims of the study, traffic and accident data during the period 2006–2011 from two major arterials in Athens were collected and processed. Firstly, a finite mixture cluster analysis was implemented to classify traffic into clusters. Afterwards, discriminant analysis was carried out in order to correctly assign new cases to the existing regimes by using a training and a testing set. Lastly, Bayesian logistic regression models were developed to investigate the impact of traffic regimes on accident likelihood and severity. The findings of this study suggest that urban traffic can be divided into different regimes by using average traffic occupancy and its standard deviation, measured by nearby upstream and downstream loop detectors. The results revealed potential hazardous traffic conditions, which are discussed in the paper. In general, high occupancy values increase accident likelihood, but tend to lead slight accidents, while PTWs are more likely to be involved in an accident, when traffic occupancy is high. Transitions from high to low occupancy also increase accident likelihood.</p>},

In an effort to deal with this problem, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) technologies have concentrated in recent years on dealing with urban congestion. One of the most critical aspects of ITS success is the provision of accurate real-time information and short-term predictions of traffic parameters such as traffic volumes, travel speeds and occupancies. The present paper concentrates on developing flexible and explicitly multivariate time-series state space models using core urban area loop detector data. Using 3-min volume measurements from urban arterial streets near downtown Athens, models were developed that feed on data from upstream detectors to improve on the predictions of downstream locations. The results clearly suggest that different model specifications are appropriate for different time periods of the day. Further, it also appears that the use of multivariate state space models improves on the prediction accuracy over univariate time series ones.},

We employ fractionally integrated dual memory models and compare results to classical time-series models in a traffic engineering context.

  abstract  = {Accurate forecasting of inter-urban traffic flow has been one of the most important issues globally in the research on road traffic congestion. However, the information of inter-urban traffic presents a challenging situation; the traffic flow forecasting involves a rather complex nonlinear data pattern, particularly during daily peak periods, traffic flow data reveals cyclic (seasonal) trend. In the recent years, the support vector regression model (SVR) has been widely used to solve nonlinear regression and time series problems. However, the applications of SVR models to deal with cyclic (seasonal) trend time series have not been widely explored. This investigation presents a traffic flow forecasting model that combines the seasonal support vector regression model with chaotic simulated annealing algorithm (SSVRCSA), to forecast inter-urban traffic flow. Additionally, a numerical example of traffic flow values from northern Taiwan is employed to elucidate the forecasting performance of the proposed SSVRCSA model. The forecasting results indicate that the proposed model yields more accurate forecasting results than the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and seasonal Holt-Winters (SHW) models. Therefore, the SSVRCSA model is a promising alternative for forecasting traffic flow.},

  abstract  = {Accurate forecasting of electricity prices can provide significant benefits to energy suppliers when allocating their assets and to energy consumers for defining an optimal portfolio. There are numerous methods that efficiently support the forecasting of time series, such as electricity prices, which have high volatility. However, the performance of these approaches varies depending on data sets and operational conditions. In this work, the concept of composite forecasting is presented and implemented in a retrospective study, in real industrial forecasting conditions to show the potential of forecast performance improvement and comparable high consistency of a forecast performance across different ‘Day Peak’ and ‘Day Base’ electricity price data sets for different seasons. As individual methods support vector regression, artificial neural networks and ridge regression are implemented. The forecast performances of these methods are evaluated and compared with their forecast combination using different error measures. The results show that composite forecasting processes with ‘inverse root mean squared error’ combination approach can generate, on average, a more accurate and robust forecast than using an individual methods or other combination schemas. •A composite forecasting approach for a systematic search of consistent, high-performance forecast combining methods from different domains•Overall improvement of forecasting performance using composite forecasting approach against individual methods reached, up to 22 percent•The performance of combined forecasts using ‘Inverse of the Root Mean Squared Errors’ outperforms other combination schemas or separate methods},

To counter this, the use of a symmetric (or modified) MAPE has been proposed. This paper shows that, in its treatment of negative and positive errors, the proposed modification is far from symmetric, particularly where these errors have large absolute values. It also shows that, under some circumstances, a non-monotonic relationship can occur between the symmetric MAPE and the absolute forecast errors.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes using artificial neural networks in a modular architecture to assist in detecting different types of operational problems on signalized urban arterials. A traffic surveillance infrastructure that includes inductive loop detectors on intersection approaches as well as mid-block system loops for traffic monitoring is used. For arterials, problems that require the attention of a traffic management center operator include lane-blocking incidents, special event conditions, and detector malfunctioning. Problem detection depends on factors such as operating conditions, configuration of sensors within the network, and block or link length. The feasibility of training and testing neural network models as components of a modular architecture, with an appropriate model for each sub-problem of pattern recognition, is demonstrated. The performance of this modular architecture exceeded that of any single architecture applied to the detection of different types of operational problems. The paper also reports on the performance of each type of model considered and the effect traffic flow levels and detector configuration have on the performance of the incident detection model. The results show that with the selection of a suitable architecture, the modular neural classifier outperforms alternative discriminant analysis-based classifiers. This is demonstrated using cyclic data from microscopic simulation and field data from Urban Traffic Control System (UTCS) implementations in the Cities of Los Angeles and Anaheim, California.},

The modelling is separated into two steps. Firstly, the traffic flow is modelled on a single signalized link by a local neural network. Secondly, based on communications between local neural networks, the traffic flow is modelled over a wide network of junctions. Based on simulated data, the paper concludes on the potentials of neural networks applied to traffic flow modelling. One minute ahead predictions of the queue lengths and the output flows have been obtained with fairly good accuracy. Nevertheless, it emphasizes the real need to further investigate these techniques on experimental data.},

The threshold value has an interesting interpretation. Simulation results are presented which demonstrate that this new class of models exhibits some well-known features of non-linear vibrations. Detailed analyses of several real data sets are discussed.},

A VAR model in first differences, with and without cointegration restrictions, and a VAR model in annual differences are also included in the analysis, where they serve as benchmark models. Our empirical results indicate that the VAR model in first differences without cointegration is best if one-step ahead forecasts are considered. For longer forecast horizons however, the VAR model in annual differences is better. When comparing periodic versus seasonal cointegration models, we find that the seasonal cointegration models tend to yield better forecasts.

  abstract  = {Optimal subset selection among a general family of threshold autoregressive moving-average (TARMA) models is considered. The usual complexity of model/order selection is increased by capturing the uncertainty of unknown threshold levels and an unknown delay lag. The Monte Carlo method of Bayesian model averaging provides a possible way to overcome such model uncertainty. Incorporating with the idea of Bayesian model averaging, a modified stochastic search variable selection method is adapted to consider subset selection in TARMA models, by adding latent indicator variables for all potential model lags as part of the proposed Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme. Metropolis–Hastings methods are employed to deal with the well-known difficulty of including moving-average terms in the model and a novel proposal mechanism is designed for this purpose. Bayesian comparison of two hyper-parameter settings is carried out via a simulation study. The results demonstrate that the modified method has favourable performance under reasonable sample size and appropriate settings of the necessary hyper-parameters. Finally, the application to four real datasets illustrates that the proposed method can provide promising and parsimonious models from more than 16 million possible subsets.},

The comparison probability is explicitly expressed and is shown to be an increasing function of the distance between nonlinear and linear forecasts under certain conditions. This expression of the comparison probability may not only be useful in determining the predictor, which is either a more accurate or a simpler forecast, to be used but also provides a good explanation for an odd phenomenon discussed by Pemberton. The relative forecast performance of a nonlinear model to a linear model is demonstrated to be sensitive to its forecast origins. A new forecast is thus proposed to improve the relative forecast performance of nonlinear models based on forecast origins. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract     = {Time series modeling and forecasting has fundamental importance to various practical domains. Thus a lot of active research works is going on in this subject during several years. Many important models have been proposed in literature for improving the accuracy and effectiveness of time series forecasting. The aim of this dissertation work is to present a concise description of some popular time series forecasting models used in practice, with their salient features. In this thesis, we have described three important classes of time series models, viz. the stochastic, neural networks and SVM based models, together with their inherent forecasting strengths and weaknesses. We have also discussed about the basic issues related to time series modeling, such as stationarity, parsimony, overfitting, etc. Our discussion about different time series models is supported by giving the experimental forecast results, performed on six real time series datasets. While fitting a model to a dataset, special care is taken to select the most parsimonious one. To evaluate forecast accuracy as well as to compare among different models fitted to a time series, we have used the five performance measures, viz. MSE, MAD, RMSE, MAPE and Theil's U-statistics. For each of the six datasets, we have shown the obtained forecast diagram which graphically depicts the closeness between the original and forecasted observations. To have authenticity as well as clarity in our discussion about time series modeling and forecasting, we have taken the help of various published research works from reputed journals and some standard books.},

Original hierarchical prior models that allow the stationarity of the model to be enforced are proposed. Obtaining the quantities of interest, such as parameter estimates, predictions of future values of the time series, posterior model?order probabilities, etc., requires integration with respect to the full posterior distribution, an operation which is analytically intractable. Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are developed to perform the required integration implicitly by simulating from the posterior distribution. The methods developed are evaluated in simulation studies on a number of synthetic and real data sets.},

  abstract = {Many scientific and economic problems involve the analysis of high-dimensional time series datasets. However, theoretical studies in high-dimensional statistics to date rely primarily on the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. In this work, we focus on stable Gaussian processes and investigate the theoretical properties of $\ell _1$-regularized estimates in two important statistical problems in the context of high-dimensional time series: (a) stochastic regression with serially correlated errors and (b) transition matrix estimation in vector autoregressive (VAR) models. We derive nonasymptotic upper bounds on the estimation errors of the regularized estimates and establish that consistent estimation under high-dimensional scaling is possible via $\ell_1$-regularization for a large class of stable processes under sparsity constraints. A key technical contribution of the work is to introduce a measure of stability for stationary processes using their spectral properties that provides insight into the effect of dependence on the accuracy of the regularized estimates. With this proposed stability measure, we establish some useful deviation bounds for dependent data, which can be used to study several important regularized estimates in a time series setting.},

  abstract  = {  This paper uses dimension asymptotics to study why overfit linear regression models should be compared out-of-sample; we let the number of predictors used by the larger model increase with the number of observations so that their ratio remains uniformly positive. Our analysis gives a theoretical motivation for using out-of-sample (OOS) comparisons: the DMW OOS test allows a forecaster to conduct inference about the expected future accuracy of his or her models when one or both is overfit. We show analytically and through Monte Carlo that standard full-sample test statistics can not test hypotheses about this performance. Our paper also shows that popular test and training sample sizes may give misleading results if researchers are concerned about overfit. We show that P 2 /T must converge to zero for theDMW test to give valid inference about the expected forecast accuracy, otherwise the test measures the accuracy of the estimates constructed using only the training sample. In empirical research, P is typically much larger than this. Our simulations indicate that using large values of P with the DMW test gives undersized tests with low power, so this practice may favor simple benchmark models too much.},

  abstract  = {Accurate and timely detection of infectious disease outbreaks provides valuable information which can enable public health officials to respond to major public health threats in a timely fashion. However, disease outbreaks are often not directly observable. For surveillance systems used to detect outbreaks, noises caused by routine behavioral patterns and by special events can further complicate the detection task. Most existing detection methods combine a time series filtering procedure followed by a statistical surveillance method. The performance of this {"}two-step¿ detection method is hampered by the unrealistic assumption that the training data are outbreak-free. Moreover, existing approaches are sensitive to extreme values, which are common in real-world data sets. We considered the problem of identifying outbreak patterns in a syndrome count time series using Markov switching models. The disease outbreak states are modeled as hidden state variables which control the observed time series. A jump component is introduced to absorb sporadic extreme values that may otherwise weaken the ability to detect slow-moving disease outbreaks. Our approach outperformed several state-of-the-art detection methods in terms of detection sensitivity using both simulated and real-world data.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we focus on the problem of the energy transition in Tunisia were we suggest to study and modeling the nonlinear dynamic of the endogenous renewable energy cycle.As today the socioeconomic development in Tunisia is too complicated and dependent on the adopted energetic strategy. Our contribution consists on recognizing exactly the main bases of this correlative development.In this context, we try to provide some theoretical and empirical studies for renewable energy politics especially under the chaotic transition in the post revolution period in Tunisia.All this work will be based on the application of the univariate STAR (smooth transition autoregressive) method composed by two transition process types the logistic STAR model (LSTAR) and the exponential STAR model (ESTAR). As results we found that the LSTAR process is more adequate for asymmetric data for our case. In this regard, our results indicated that the renewable energy can not only work as a possible factor for energetic strategy transition in Tunisia, but also, is a promising candidate for stability and socioeconomic development. •The transition to renewable energy becoming a necessity for sustainable development of Tunisia.•There is a possibility of providing economic growth by adopting the policy of transition to renewable energy.•The empirical analysis can prove the presence of unit root with one endogenous structural break.•The dynamic of the renewable energy transition cycle in Tunisia is nonlinear.•The transition to renewable energy in Tunisia can be generated from the LSTAR process.},

  title        = {Sparsity information and regularization in the horseshoe and other shrinkage priors},
  abstract     = {The horseshoe prior has proven to be a noteworthy alternative for sparse Bayesian estimation, but has previously suffered from two problems. First, there has been no systematic way of specifying a prior for the global shrinkage hyperparameter based on the prior information about the degree of sparsity in the parameter vector. Second, the horseshoe prior has the undesired property that there is no possibility of specifying separately information about sparsity and the amount of regularization for the largest coefficients, which can be problematic with weakly identified parameters, such as the logistic regression coefficients in the case of data separation. This paper proposes solutions to both of these problems. We introduce a concept of effective number of nonzero parameters, show an intuitive way of formulating the prior for the global hyperparameter based on the sparsity assumptions, and argue that the previous default choices are dubious based on their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk parameters than we typically expect a priori. Moreover, we introduce a generalization to the horseshoe prior, called the regularized horseshoe, that allows us to specify a minimum level of regularization to the largest values. We show that the new prior can be considered as the continuous counterpart of the spike-and-slab prior with a finite slab width, whereas the original horseshoe resembles the spike-and-slab with an infinitely wide slab. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real world data illustrate the benefit of both of these theoretical advances.},

We argue that the previous default choices are dubious due to their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk coefficients than we typically expect a priori. This can lead to bad results if this parameter is not strongly identified by data. We derive the relationship between the global parameter and the effective number of nonzeros in the coefficient vector, and show an easy and intuitive way of setting up the prior for the global parameter based on our prior beliefs about the number of nonzero coefficients in the model. The results on real world data show that one can benefit greatly -- in terms of improved parameter estimates, prediction accuracy, and reduced computation time -- from transforming even a crude guess for the number of nonzero coefficients into the prior for the global parameter using our framework.},

The model is able to capture serial correlations, time-varying means and volatilities, and the shape of the conditional distributions can be time varied from short-tailed to long-tailed, or from unimodal to multimodal. The use of t-distributed errors in each component of the model allows conditional leptokurtic distributions that account for the commonly observed excess unconditional kurtosis in financial data. Methods of parameter estimation and model selection are given. Finally, the proposed modelling procedure is illustrated through a real example.},

  abstract  = {The t distribution provides a useful extension of the normal for statistical modeling of data sets involving errors with longer-than-normal tails. An analytical strategy based on maximum likelihood for a general model with multivariate t errors is suggested and applied to a variety of problems, including linear and nonlinear regression, robust estimation of the mean and covariance matrix with missing data, unbalanced multivariate repeated-measures data, multivariate modeling of pedigree data, and multivariate nonlinear regression. The degrees of freedom parameter of the t distribution provides a convenient dimension for achieving robust statistical inference, with moderate increases in computational complexity for many models. Estimation of precision from asymptotic theory and the bootstrap is discussed, and graphical methods for checking the appropriateness of the t distribution are presented.},

  abstract  = {In the context of Bayes estimation via Gibbs sampling, with or without data augmentation, a simple approach is developed for computing the marginal density of the sample data (marginal likelihood) given parameter draws from the posterior distribution. Consequently, Bayes factors for model comparisons can be routinely computed as a by-product of the simulation. Hitherto, this calculation has proved extremely challenging. Our approach exploits the fact that the marginal density can be expressed as the prior times the likelihood function over the posterior density. This simple identity holds for any parameter value. An estimate of the posterior density is shown to be available if all complete conditional densities used in the Gibbs sampler have closed-form expressions. To improve accuracy, the posterior density is estimated at a high density point, and the numerical standard error of resulting estimate is derived. The ideas are applied to probit regression and finite mixture models.},
